### Graph Colouring

Study:

- [Brook's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27_theorem) gives an upper bound on the chromatic number of a graph.
- Brute force search, as there is no fast algorithm to find the exact optimal colouring.
- [Greedy colouring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring).
- [Bipartite graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph) are graphs that can be coloured with 2 colours.
